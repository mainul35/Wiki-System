This was an assignment project requested by a junior student. It was done by JAVA Swing Technology, SQLite and Weblaf look and feel.

The requirements were:
i. 3 levels of users- Admin, Tutor, Student.
ii. Admin and tutor can read and edit blog posts, but student can only read a post and can't write unless admin provides permission.
iii. The blog posts can then be saved html format.

There are some silly bugs in this project which were not solved were not solved willingly, as it was an assignment project.
